                        The best cat essentials list includes everything you need for a happy cat.
                        It's important to have a clean litter box and food and water bowls, 
                        fun cat furniture, enrichment, and safety essentials before you bring your new cat home.
                        These essentials will help make your new cat feel at home.

                        Wild cats get exercise and mental stimulation from hunting. 
                        Indoor cats don't hunt. So they must play.
                        Always buy high-quality cat toys free from synthetic materials and harsh chemicals.
                        Most big pet manufacturers typically use synthetic materials and harsh chemicals.
                        These harmful materials and chemicals can cause stress and allergic reactions in cats.
                        That potentially means expensive vet bills and an upset cat.

                        Window watching is the cat's best friend. 
                        The window provides endless entertainment for your cat.
                        A window perch gives your cat a safe way to watch beyond his territory. 
                        This helps cats feel safe, comfortable, and happy.

                        A good quality cat carrier is essential. 
                        Cats prefer a soft-case carrier because it's comfortable and it doesn't feel like a prison.
                        A soft-case cat carrier is essential because it makes traveling easier. 
                        That means a less stressed cat.

                        Some cats will sleep with their humans every night. Jericho cuddles with me every night!
                        However, extra private beds will make your cat feel safe in his territory.
                        Put some blankets in a box for a DIY bed. Cats love boxes!
                        Private beds make cats happy because it's a safe, warm spot for napping

                        Activity centers provide lots of enrichment. 
                        There are multiple ways to use them and play with them.
                        The Ripple Rug makes cats happy because there are many ways to use it. 
                        Cats love to scratch the rugs and hunt for toys inside the ripples.
